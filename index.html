            <div class="top">
            <p>
                The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7 March 1916, when an aircraft engine 
                manufacturer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG was formed. This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) 
                in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company used the name BMW (which in German appears 
                as Rapp Motorenwerke). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of 
                World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. 
                The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923.

                Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, 
                against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles 
                as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and 
                its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, 
                the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed 
                car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through 
                the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins 
                from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by 
                rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving 
                as a separate entity. The BMW 700 was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.

        <h3>Motorcycles</h3>
        <p>BMW's motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines for other companies. 
        BMW's own motorcycles— sold under the BMW Motorrad brand— began in 1923 with the BMW R 32,[22] which was powered 
        by a flat-twin engine (also called a "boxer-twin" engine). Production of motorcycles with flat-twin engines continues 
        to this day, however BMW has also produced many models with other types of engine.</p>
